# KnowledgeFlow
**A Domain-Driven Knowledge Workflow System**

## Overview
KnowledgeFlow is a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)-based** system for managing **internal knowledge workflows**. It provides a structured way for teams to **submit, review, and approve markdown-based knowledgebase documents**, with plans to integrate **AI-assisted retrieval**.

The goal is to support **structured knowledge sharing** and **reliable AI-assisted knowledge retrieval**.

---

## Key Features (Work in Progress)
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture** for clear separation of concerns
- **Markdown-based knowledge storage** with structured approval workflows
- **Event-driven architecture** (planned)
- **AI-assisted contextual retrieval** (future roadmap)

---

## Project Structure
KnowledgeFlow follows **DDD principles**, with clear separation between **domain, application, infrastructure, and interfaces layers**.
